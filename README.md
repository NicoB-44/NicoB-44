- 👋 Hi, I’m @NicoB-44
- 👀 I’m not a real developer. I'm a Product Manager, but working closely with tech teams and still pretty interested in keeping my hands in a bit of code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Data, and probably how to use Unity.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small passionated projects, but that's quite a stretch goal.
- 📫 How to reach me ... 
- 😄 Pronouns: I'm a He.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm credited as a developer of a splinter cell game... on Nokia mobile in 2003
