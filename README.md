- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NicoB-44
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m not a exactly developer. I'm a Product Manager, but working closely with tech teams and still pretty interested in keeping my hands in a bit of code.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and Data, and probably how to use Unity.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm credited as a developer of a splinter cell game... on Nokia mobile in 2003
